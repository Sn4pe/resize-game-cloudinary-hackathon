# Resize Game

Welcome to Resize Game! This is a project created for the midudev hackathon sponsored by Cloudinary. The game is simple: when you press the start button, a random image will be generated and displayed for two seconds. Your task is to guess the width and height of the image in pixels. After you submit your guess, the game will display the percentage of accuracy and the actual dimensions of the image.

## How to Play

1. Click the "Start" button to generate a random image.
2. Study the image for two seconds.
3. Enter your guess for the width and height of the image in pixels.
4. Click the "Submit" button to check your guess.
5. The game will display the percentage of accuracy and the actual dimensions of the image.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using tailwind, Svelte, and TypeScript. We also used Cloudinary's image management platform to handle image generation and display.
